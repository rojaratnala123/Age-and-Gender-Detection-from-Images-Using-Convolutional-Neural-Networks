# Age-and-Gender-Detection-from-Images-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
This project aims to build a reliable system for determining age and gender from images through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By harnessing advanced deep learning techniques, the system seeks to accurately identify the age and gender of individuals by analyzing visual data from photographs.
